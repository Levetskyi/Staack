Features:

- Gameplay Mechanics: Experience the classic stacking gameplay where blocks descend, and the player must align them perfectly to build a tower.
- Endless Mode: Test your skills in an endless mode where the difficulty gradually increases as the tower grows taller.
- Sleek UI/UX: Enjoy a clean and intuitive user interface designed for an engaging gaming experience.
- Scoring System: Keep track of your high scores and challenge yourself to beat them.

How to Play:

- Stacking Blocks: Place the descending blocks onto the existing tower by tapping at the right moment to create a perfectly stacked layer.
- Building the Tower: Aim to stack blocks as accurately as possible to keep the tower stable and prevent any parts from being trimmed off.
- Endless Challenge: Keep stacking to achieve the highest tower possible without losing any pieces.

Development:

This project was developed as a personal endeavor to learn Unity and C# game development. Feel free to explore the codebase, provide feedback, or contribute to enhance the gameplay experience.
